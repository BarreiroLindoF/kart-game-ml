This project was made in the context of open days at HEG Geneva for the IT branch. We use the Karting Microgame given by Unity (https://learn.unity.com/project/karting-template) as a base and extend it to create our own IA.

As we wanted this activity to be attractive, we decided to let users play the game and get back their actions to feed a Neural Network in backend. This wasn't the solution who gave us the best results, however it was the one who allow us to attract students and then to be able to explain deeper how Machine Learning algorithm work.
